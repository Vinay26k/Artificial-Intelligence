# Natural Language Processing
Natural Language Processing is a technique of making any system understand the human interaction language.<br>
It is often used  to **analyse emotional situation** of interacting person, like positive, negative about situation i.e, **sentiment analysis**,
**predictions**, **impact of business growth**, **stock market trading opinions** etc..<br>

### Pre-requisites (Knowledge)
* Python Programming
* numpy, sklearn, matplotlib (Beginner level is enough)
* Machine Learning Algorithms (I'll try to teach them again when using)
  * Naive Bayes
  * Linear Models like Linear, Logistic Regression
* Able to experiment with code

### Pre-requisites (Physical resources)
* Python (3.x or above)
* 64-bit (Must)
* I5, 4Gb RAM (Minimum)

##### About Me
* I'm a self-taught programmer, I referred many articles, videos, books and want to provide easy way for other people to understand.
* I might make errors, mistakes because I'm not a professional at this content, feel free to **correct me**.
* **I belive in teaching others, enhances knowledge about concepts**.
* I will make learning so precise and edge to the point. Refer any time, contents will be uploaded slowly, before starting any new concept I'll introduce it clearly.
* **_Open for Contributions, feel free to pull and merge requests_**.

### About you
* If you're afraid of Machine Learning, often losing interest in that field or you're a beginner. You're chosing the **right branch** of Artificial Intelligence.
* **_Natural Language Processing_** is easy.

### Happy Machine Learning!
